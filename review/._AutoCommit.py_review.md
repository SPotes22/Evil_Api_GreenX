# Code Review for AutoCommit.py

This Python code automates the process of adding, committing, and optionally pushing changes to a Git repository. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Import `subprocess`:**
   - `import subprocess` allows the script to run external commands (like Git commands) from within the Python script.

2. **Get Commit Message from User:**
   - `mensaje = input("Mensaje del commit: ")` prompts the user to enter a commit message.  The message they enter is stored in the `mensaje` variable. This makes the commit more descriptive.

3. **Ask User for Push Confirmation:**
   - `confirm = input("¿Hacer push? (s/n): ").lower()` asks the user if they want to push the changes.  It accepts input "s" for yes and "n" for no (and converts the input to lowercase for easier comparison).  The answer is stored in the `confirm` variable.

4. **Stage Changes (git add .):**
   - `subprocess.run(["git", "add", "."])` executes the `git add .` command.  This stages all modified and new files in the current directory and its subdirectories for the next commit. The `.` specifies to add all changes in the current directory.

5. **Commit Changes (git commit -m "message"):**
   - `subprocess.run(["git", "commit", "-m", mensaje])` executes the `git commit -m "message"` command. This creates a new commit with the provided message.  The `-m` flag specifies that the commit message is provided directly as an argument.  The `mensaje` variable (containing the user's input) is used as the commit message.

6. **Conditional Push (git push):**
   - `if confirm == "s":` checks if the user entered "s" (for yes) to push the changes.
     - `subprocess.run(["git", "push"])` If the user entered "s", this executes the `git push` command. This pushes the local commit(s) to the remote repository.
   - `else:` If the user did *not* enter "s":
     - `print("Push cancelado.")` This prints "Push cancelado." (Push cancelled) to the console, indicating that the push operation was skipped.

**In Summary:**

The script provides a simple interface for adding, committing, and optionally pushing changes to a Git repository.  It allows the user to provide a commit message and decide whether or not to push the changes, adding a bit of interactivity to the standard Git workflow.  It's useful for quickly committing and pushing changes from a command line environment.
